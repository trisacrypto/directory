// Implements a protocol buffer struct for state managed pagination. This struct will be
// marshaled into a url-safe base64 encoded string and sent to the user as the
// next_page_token. The server should decode this struct to determine where to continue
// iteration for the next page. Note that the server should check to make sure the page
// size in the cursor matches the page size in the request.
// See https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/design_patterns#list_pagination for more.
