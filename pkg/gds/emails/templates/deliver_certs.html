<p>Hello {{ .Name }},</p>

<p>Your TRISA network registration has been approved! Your organization has been granted
identity certificates validating your membership to other TRISA members via the TRISA
Global Directory. Attached to this email are PKCS12 encrypted certificates so that you
can implement the TRISA  protocol using mTLS with other network members to exchange
Travel Rule compliance information.</p>

<p>The primary details of your directory entry are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>ID:</strong> {{ .VID }}</li>
	<li><strong>Common Name:</strong> {{ .CommonName }}</li>
	<li><strong>Serial Number:</strong> {{ .SerialNumber }}</li>
	<li><strong>Endpoint:</strong> {{ .Endpoint }}</li>
</ul>

<p>To decrypt your certificates, <em>you will need the PKCS12 password</em> that you
received when you first submitted your registration. To decrypt the certificates on the
command line, you can use <code>openssl</code> as follows:</p>

<pre>$ openssl pkcs12 -in INFILE.p12 -out OUTFILE.crt -nodes</pre>

<p>For more information on integrating with the TRISA network, please see our
documentation at <a href="https://trisatest.net/">trisatest.net</a>. If you have any
