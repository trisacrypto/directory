<p>Hello TRISA Admins,</p>

<p>We have received a new TRISA Global Directory registration request from a VASP that
needs to be reviewed. The requestor has verified their email address(es) and received a
PKCS12 password to decrypt a certificate which will be generated only if you approve this
request. The request YAML is:</p>

<pre>{{ .Request }}</pre>

<p>To verify or reject the registration request, use the following metadata with the
<code>gds review</code> command:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ID: <strong>{{ .VID }}</strong></li>
	<li>Token: <strong>{{ .Token }}</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>To accept the registration, use the command line tool as follows:</p>

<p><code>$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t {{ .Token }} -a</code></p>

<p>To reject the registration, provide a rejection message as the last argument:</p>

<p><code>$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t {{ .Token }} -R -m ""</code></p>

<p>Note that we're working to create a URL endpoint for the
<a href="https://vaspdirectory.net/">vaspdirectory.net</a> site to simplify the review
process. We're sorry about the inconvenience of this method at the early stage of the
TRISA network.</p>

<p>Best Regards,<br />
TRISA Global Directory Service Team</p>
