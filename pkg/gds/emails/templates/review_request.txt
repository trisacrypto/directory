Hello TRISA Admins,

We have received a new TRISA Global Directory registration request from a VASP that
needs to be reviewed. The requestor has verified their email address(es) and received a
PKCS12 password to decrypt a certificate which will be generated only if you approve this
request. The request JSON is:

{{ .Request }}

To verify or reject the registration request, use the following metadata with the gds review command:

ID: {{ .VID }}
Token: {{ .Token }}

To accept the registration, use the command line tool as follows:

$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t {{ .Token }} -a

To reject the registration, provide a rejection message as the last argument:

$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t {{ .Token }} -R -m ""

Note that we're working to create a URL endpoint for the vaspdirectory.net site to simplify the review process. We're sorry about the inconvenience of this method at the early stage of the TRISA network.

Best Regards,
The TRISA Global Directory Service
