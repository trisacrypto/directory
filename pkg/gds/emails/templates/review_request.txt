Hello TRISA Admins,

We have received a new TRISA Global Directory registration request from a VASP that
needs to be reviewed. The requestor has verified their email address(es) and received a
PKCS12 password to decrypt a certificate which will be generated only if you approve this
request. You can view details about the registration on the Admin site:

{{ .AdminReviewURL }}

The request YAML is:

{{ .Request }}

To verify or reject the registration request, use the following metadata:

ID: {{ .VID }}
Token: {{ .Token }}
Registered Directory: {{ .RegisteredDirectory }}

To accept the registration, use the command line tool as follows:

$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t "{{ .Token }}" -a

To reject the registration, provide a rejection message as the last argument:

$ gds review -i {{ .VID }} -t "{{ .Token }}" -R -m ""

Please note that you'll need to specify the correct directory endpoint for the CLI
command to work.

Best Regards,
TRISA Global Directory Service Team
