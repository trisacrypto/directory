Hello {{ .Name }},

Your TRISA network registration has been approved! Your organization has been granted identity certificates validating your membership to other TRISA members via the TRISA Global Directory. Attached to this email are PKCS12 encrypted certificates so that you can implement the TRISA protocol using mTLS with other network members to exchange Travel Rule compliance information.

The primary details of your directory entry are as follows:

ID: {{ .VID }}
Registered Directory: {{ .RegisteredDirectory }}
Common Name: {{ .CommonName }}
Serial Number: {{ .SerialNumber }}
Endpoint: {{ .Endpoint }}

To decrypt your certificates, you will need the PKCS12 password that you received when you first submitted your registration. To decrypt the unzipped certificates on the command line, you can use openssl as follows (you will be prompted to enter your password):

openssl pkcs12 -in INFILE.p12 -out OUTFILE.crt -nodes
