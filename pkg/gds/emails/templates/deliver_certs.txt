Hello {{ .Name }},

Your TRISA network registration has been approved (or reapproved)! Your organization has been granted identity certificates validating your membership to other TRISA members via the TRISA Global Directory. Attached to this email are PKCS12 encrypted certificates so that you can implement the TRISA protocol using mTLS with other network members to exchange Travel Rule compliance information.

The primary details of your directory entry are as follows:

ID: {{ .VID }}
Registered Directory: {{ .RegisteredDirectory }}
Organization: {{ .Organization }}
Common Name: {{ .CommonName }}
Serial Number: {{ .SerialNumber }}
Endpoint: {{ .Endpoint }}

To decrypt your certificates, you will need a PKCS12 password. If this is the first certificate you've recieved after registration, you'll need the PKCS12 password that was displayed during the registration process. If these are annually re-issued certificates, you'll need the PCKS12 password that was emailed to you via a one-time Whisper link preceding this email.

To decrypt the unzipped certificates on the command line, you can use `openssl` as described in our documentation here:
