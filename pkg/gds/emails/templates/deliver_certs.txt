Hello {{ .Name }},

Your TRISA network registration has been approved! Your organization has been granted identity certificates validating your membership to other TRISA members via the TRISA Global Directory. Attached to this email are PKCS12 encrypted certificates so that you can implement the TRISA  protocol using mTLS with other network members to exchange Travel Rule compliance information.

The primary details of your directory entry are as follows:

ID: {{ .VID }}
Common Name: {{ .CommonName }}
Serial Number: {{ .SerialNumber }}
Endpoint: {{ .Endpoint }}

To decrypt your certificates, you will need the PKCS12 password that you received when you first submitted your registration. To decrypt the certificates on the command line, you can use openssl as follows:

openssl pkcs12 -in INFILE.p12 -out OUTFILE.crt -nodes

For more information on integrating with the TRISA network, please visit our documentation at https://trisatest.net/. If you have any questions, you may contact us at admin@trisa.io or join us on our Slack channel trisa-workspace.slack.com.

Best Regards,
The TRISA Global Directory Service
